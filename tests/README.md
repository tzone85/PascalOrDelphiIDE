# Tests Directory

This directory contains test files and Pascal examples for the Pholani Pascal IDE.

## File Structure

### Documentation Files
- **`simple-tests.md`**: Basic Pascal examples perfect for beginners and initial testing
- **`test-examples.md`**: Advanced Pascal programs demonstrating complex concepts and features

### Pascal Source Files
- **`simple-test.pas`**: Basic Pascal test program
- **`test-simple.pas`**: Simple Pascal test program
- **`test.pas`**: General Pascal test program

### Compiled Files
- **Binary executables**: Compiled Pascal programs (platform-specific)
- **Object files (*.o)**: Compilation artifacts

## Usage

### For Students
1. Start with examples from `simple-tests.md`
2. Progress to more complex examples in `test-examples.md`
3. Use the `.pas` files as reference implementations

### For Development
- Use these files to test IDE functionality
- Verify compilation and execution features
- Test error handling and edge cases

### File Management
- Compiled files and executables are generated during testing
- These can be safely deleted and will be regenerated as needed
- Source `.pas` files should be preserved

## Educational Progression

1. **Beginner**: Copy examples from `simple-tests.md` into the IDE
2. **Intermediate**: Modify and extend the examples
3. **Advanced**: Try examples from `test-examples.md`
4. **Expert**: Create your own Pascal programs

## Note
These test files are separate from the IDE's built-in examples and serve as additional learning resources and development testing materials.
